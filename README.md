# To-Do App

A simple To-Do list web application that allows users to add, check off, and remove tasks. This app uses JavaScript and cookies to save tasks so they persist across page reloads for up to 7 days.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to your to-do list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Click on a task to toggle its "checked" status, marking it as completed (strikethrough effect).
- **Remove Tasks**: Each task has a close button to remove it from the list.
- **Persistent Data**: The app uses cookies to save the list of tasks, so your to-do items are remembered even after a page reload, for up to 7 days.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile screens.
